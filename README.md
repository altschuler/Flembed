Flembed is an easy way to embed SWF and image files in an HTML file.

Features
** Preview the resulting HTML page
** Set flashvars that will be sent to the SWFs
** SWFObject is used and automatically added to the generated files (it can even be hardcoded into the HTML)
** A zip file can be generated during export containing the generated files

The purpose of Flembed is to leverage testing and previewing. It is not meant for production use.
